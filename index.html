    <strong>Big Data</strong> refers to data sets that are too <em>large or complex</em> to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.</p> 
    <h3 id="sec1">Introduction</h3>
    <hr />
    The term big data has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term.[21][22] Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time.[23] Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data; however, the main focus is on unstructured data.[24] Big data "size" is a constantly moving target; as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data.[25] Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data-sets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale.

    <hr />
    A 2018 definition states "Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data", and notes, "This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used, via parallel programming theories, and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codd's relational model."[28]In a comparative study of big datasets, Kitchin and McArdle found that none of the commonly considered characteristics of big data appear consistently across all of the analyzed cases.[29] For this reason, other studies identified the redefinition of power dynamics in knowledge discovery as the defining trait.[30]

    Instead of focusing on intrinsic characteristics of big data, this alternative perspective pushes forward a relational understanding of the object claiming that what matters is the way in which data is collected, stored, made available and analyzed.
